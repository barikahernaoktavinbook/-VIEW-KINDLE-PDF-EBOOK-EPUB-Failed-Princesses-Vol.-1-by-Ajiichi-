Failed Princesses Vol. 1 by Ajiichi Book Review

Name: Eldweena
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Cute...but is it really yuri?
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020
Review: I thought the first volume of this new manga was incredibly adorable and enjoyable to read, but so far there actually is no hint of yuri. Rather, this manga is about high school cliques. There are the pretty, well-off, preppy girls, then there are the nerdy, plain-Jane, quiet ones. And when one of the preps tries to befriend a nerd, the cliques clash and reject both girls, leaving them to be each other's only friend.

The two main characters are prep girl Fujishiro and self-conscious nerd Kurokawa. This manga is a bit different, in that the two girls always refer to each other by their last names, even as they grow close. Fujishiro's boyfriend dumps her, and she is surprised to find Kurokawa defending her even though she has often mocked Kurokawa for reading yaoi manga and neglecting her appearance. She comes to feel sorry for misjudging Kurokawa and wants to make it up to her by giving her make-overs.

This is the one problem I had with the manga. Fujishiro wants to become friends with Kurokawa, now that she sees she is a nice person, but I didn't like how she went about bonding with the other girl by trying to change who she is. She forces Kurokawa to have her eyebrows plucked, get her hair cut and styled differently, buy a whole new wardrobe, and wear makeup. And then in the end Fujishiro is actually upset because she's worried Kurokawa looks cuter than she does. I felt there was too much emphasis on appearances and the need to be cute to be considered a worthwhile friend.

Other than that, I loved the manga. The art is adorable. There was one panel where Kurokawa's arms looked suddenly disproportionately short, but overall the art is of really nice quality, both cute and beautiful. I did like both characters, even though Fujishiro is incredibly pushy and conceited. My favorite was Kurokawa, and I loved that she is a fujoshi! She buys boys' love manga and her bedroom is plastered with BL posters. Based on this one volume, I wouldn't think this was a yuri manga at all, but I'm still interested in the characters and to see where this story goes. I just hope it pulls itself out of these shallow depths and that their friendship/relationship is based on more than appearances.

Title: Two young women stumbling into each others' lives
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020
Review: I thought this new title might have potential. I turned out to be right. Failed Princesses has a very good first volume about two unlikely people who become friends (and we will have to see if it goes further than that). Fujishiro is the darling of her school. She reminded me of another favorite character, Hime, from Yuri Is My Job!. Both are obsessed with being cute and popular, although Fujishiro doesn't carry this to the near-pathological intensity of Hime. Fujishiro's boyfriend callously dumps her and it turns out the class wallflower Kurokawa was nearby, overhearing. When Kurokawa is supportive, Fujishiro starts getting closer to this girl. Kurokawa doesn't know what to make of this person coming into her life like a one-woman tank division. There is also the matter of how their friends react to this new relationship. Fujishiro and Kurokawa are interesting and likeable characters, both the writing and art are strong and I will look forward to seeing how this series develops.

Title: This is fun. I like where it's going.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020
Review: The girls seem like they are meant to be together. Their friends have abandoned them in disgust. What a shame. Teen girls can be so cruel. Well if they stick together, they can overcome any obstacle. And they're both so cute! I can't wait to see how their friendship (and more!) Develop. Those other girls sure are mean though. Ugh. Well the 2 protagonists are what matter. I think they're meant for each other. I look forward to the next volume. Art, very good. Dialogue, excellent. Characters, believable, likeable, adorable.

Title: Must-read for Yuri lovers!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020
Review: First off, I CANNOT get over how much I love the artwork! The art is so cute and I marvel over the way the author draws hair especially lol. The story is also very sweet! Seeing the two girls‚Äô relationship grow is so satisfying and I especially love the concept of the snotty girl falling for the one she used to bully. I found this to be a refreshing, new type of school-girl yuri manga! Highly recommend!

Title: Failed Princess for the win!

Review: I'm happy I purchased this manga, it was definitely worth it. The characters are excellently drawn and easily likeable .. Well at first Fujishiro is not, but she comes around! The story flows perfectly, and I need more of it!

Title: Cute series!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2020
Review: Ack, this manga is so cute!! A cute popular girl and an un-cute fujoshi become unlikely friends. This yuri manga is hilarious, especially in some of the moments where Fujishiro is trying to convince Kurokawa to let her "repay her with her body." There is one part where Fujishiro is plucking Kurokawa's eyebrows and if you didn't know better you'd swear everything was VERY sexual... *wink* Also I love how completely pulled by her whims Fujishiro is - ahh, the joys of being a highschool girl.

I can't wait to read more of this great, hilarious series!

Title: Cute book, love the art
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020
Review: The book was very cute and had a lot of realistic emotional drama... but I do think that as far as friendship goes, personality was overlooked and appearance got in the way. It would have been nicer to see the girls get along more personality-wise than caring so much about each other's looks. Also, I'd read somewhere that this is Yuri, but there is very little to no Yuri in this book... at least in the first one.
